# Advent of Code 2020 ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions of the twenty-five days of [Eric Wastl](http://www.was.tl)â€™s [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). The solutions are in Python (3.8+), with liberal use of [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [array-oriented methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming).

Additionally, Iâ€™ve written a commentary on nine of the neatest puzzles: 
*[Five Themes from the Advent of Code 2020](https://github.com/egnha/AoC-2020/blob/main/FiveThemes.md)*.

*Kudos and hearty thanks to Eric Wastl for creating such a fun and educational diversion!*

## Reproducing the Python environment

Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) and invoke the following command:

```sh
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

This creates a conda environment named `aoc2020`, which includes [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org).
