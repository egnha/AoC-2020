```python
import re

with open("../data/02.txt", "r") as f:
    entries = re.findall(r"(\d+)-(\d+) ([a-z]): ([a-z]+)\n", f.read())
    entries = [(int(lwr), int(upr), *rest) for lwr, upr, *rest in entries]
```

## Part 1


```python
def length(xs):
    return sum(1 for _ in xs)

def valid(entry):
    lwr, upr, ltr, pw = entry
    return lwr <= length(c for c in pw if c == ltr) <= upr

assert 410 == length(filter(valid, entries))
```

## Part 2


```python
def valid_new(entry):
    lwr, upr, ltr, pw = entry
    return (pw[lwr - 1] == ltr) ^ (pw[upr - 1] == ltr)

assert 694 == length(filter(valid_new, entries))
```
