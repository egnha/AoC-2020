# [Day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24): Lobby Layout


```python
import re

pat = re.compile(r"e|ne|nw|w|sw|se")

with open("../data/24.txt", "r") as f:
    paths = [pat.findall(l.strip()) for l in f.readlines()]
```

## Part 1

Identify the plane with the complex numbers. Then paths in a *regular* hexagonal lattice, starting from a fixed point of origin, are in one-to-one correspondence with sums of sixth roots of unity. If $\zeta$ is the (primitive) sixth root of unity $e^{\pi i/3}$, then the directions *e*, *ne*, *nw*, *w*, *sw*, *se* correspond to $1$, $\zeta$, $\zeta-1$, $-1$, $-\zeta$, $-\zeta+1$, respectively. In fact, whether the lattice is regular or skewed doesn't matter, because we only care about computing the number of times a lattice point is reached by a path. Only the linear independence of $1$ and $\zeta$ over the real numbers is relevant. In this case, a natural choice for $\zeta$ is $i$ (the "north-east" direction).


```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

moves = dict(e=1+0j, ne=1j, nw=-1+1j, w=-1+0j, sw=-1j, se=1-1j)

def blacken(paths):
    visits = Counter(sum(map(moves.__getitem__, p)) for p in paths)
    return np.array([t for t, v in visits.items() if v % 2], dtype=complex)

black = blacken(paths)
assert 351 == len(black)
```

## Part 2


```python
from functools import reduce

shift = np.fromiter(moves.values(), dtype=complex).reshape(-1, 1)

def flip(black, _):
    nbhs = Counter((black + shift).flat)
    return np.concatenate(([b for b, n in nbhs.items() if n == 2],
                           [b for b in black if nbhs.get(b) == 1]))

assert 3869 == len(reduce(flip, range(100), black))
```
